## :open_book: User Story
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
    - THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
    - THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
- WHEN I click on the GitHub username
    - THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- WHEN I start the application
    - THEN I am prompted to enter the team managerâ€™s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- WHEN I enter the team managerâ€™s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
    - THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
- WHEN I select the engineer option
    - THEN I am prompted to enter the engineerâ€™s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
- WHEN I select the intern option
    - THEN I am prompted to enter the internâ€™s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
- WHEN I decide to finish building my team
    - THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
